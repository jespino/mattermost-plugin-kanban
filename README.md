# Sample Plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-sample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-sample)

This plugin serves as a starting point for writing a Mattermost plugin. Feel free to base your own plugin off this repository.

## Getting Started
Shallow clone the repository to a directory matching your plugin name:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-sample com.example.my-plugin
```

Edit `plugin.json` with your `id`, `name`, and `description`:
```
{
    "id": "com.example.my-plugin",
    "name": "My Plugin",
    "description": "A plugin to enhance Mattermost."
}
```

Build your plugin:
```
make
```

This will produce a single plugin file (with support for multiple architectures) for upload to your Mattermost server:

```
dist/com.example.my-plugin.tar.gz
```

There is a build target to automate deploying and enabling the plugin to your server, but it requires configuration and [http](https://httpie.org/) to be installed:
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
make deploy
```

Alternatively, if you are running your `mattermost-server` out of a sibling directory by the same name, use the `deploy` target alone to  unpack the files into the right directory. You will need to restart your server and manually enable your plugin.

In production, deploy and upload your plugin via the [System Console](https://about.mattermost.com/default-plugin-uploads).

## Q&A

### How do I make a server-only or web app-only plugin?

Simply delete the `server` or `webapp` folders and remove the corresponding sections from `plugin.json`. The build scripts will skip the missing portions automatically.
